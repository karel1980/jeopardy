# Jeopardy

This software will allow you to become the host of a jeopardy game.

## Preparation

Prepare your questions and team names in the file named `jeopardy.json`.
TODO: create a nice gui to edit these

## Running the game

Run the Godot 'intro' scene to get started.
Be aware that at this point, game state is not persisted, so if the game crashes or is terminated, scores will be reset.
