# Jeopardy

This software will allow you to become the host of a jeopardy game.

- IMPROVEMENT: when third team answered wrong, don't re-enable buzzers
- TODO: sound effect for correct and wrong answers

- TODO: fallback mode in case buzzers don't work?
- TODO: implement 'double jeopardy' questions? (i.e. only current contestant can play, wagers some amount, double or nothing)

- TODO: prepare quiz questions (in progress - see google drive)
- TODO: do a dry run (family game questions)

- WONTDO: final jeopardy (one question, everyone writes answer down beforehand)

## Preparation

Prepare your questions and team names in the file named `jeopardy.json`.
TODO: create a nice gui to edit these

## Running the game

Run the 'main' scene to get started.
