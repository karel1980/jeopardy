# Jeopardy

This software will allow you to become the host of a jeopardy game.

As a host, you'll need 2 screens: 
 - One for the players (you'll probably want a large screen or a projector)
 - One for you, the host

## Preparation

Prepare your questions and team names in the file named `jeopardy.json`.
TODO: create a nice gui to edit these

## Running the game
